# Scripts Component

Python utilities for managing historical reports and generating web interfaces for the Hermes peer score tool.

## Key Integration Patterns

- **GitHub Pages Integration**: Download historical reports from `ethpandaops.github.io/hermes-peer-score/` using manifest-based approach
- **Date-Based File Organization**: Reports organized in `reports/YYYY-MM-DD/` directory structure with timestamp-based filenames
- **28-Day Retention Policy**: Automatically filter and manage reports with configurable cutoff periods

## Important Constraints

- Always use `curl -f -s` for robust HTTP downloads with proper error handling
- Graceful error handling - scripts should not fail CI builds (exit 0 on errors)
- Template replacement uses regex patterns for HTML generation, not full template engines
- Environment variable integration for dynamic configuration (CUTOFF_DATE)
