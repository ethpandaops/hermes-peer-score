# Hermes Peer Score Tool

Ethereum peer connection health analyzer using Hermes as gossipsub listener with optional AI-enhanced reporting.

## Core Operational Patterns

- **Concurrent Peer Monitoring**: Always protect shared peer data with mutex locks (`peersMu.RLock/Lock`)
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Use callback patterns for real-time peer event handling
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement context cancellation for clean termination of monitoring processes
- **Dual Report Generation**: Support both JSON data export and AI-enhanced HTML reporting

## Integration Constraints

- Requires Prysm beacon node connectivity (gRPC/HTTP with TLS auto-detection)
- Hermes dependency must be compatible with target Ethereum network
- OpenRouter API integration is optional but enhances report analysis
- CLI flag configuration with environment variable fallback for sensitive data
